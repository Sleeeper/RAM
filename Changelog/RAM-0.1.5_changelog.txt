			* Optimized ingame waypoints rendering a bit.
			* Fixed enlarged minimap being completely zoomed out not being considered when calculating the update radius.
			* Fixed incorrect entity render radius when using enlarged minimap.
			* Fixed update radius being calculated inaccurately (unrelated to enlarged minimap).
			* Fixed zoom key bindings not being ignored when using the completely zoomed out enlarged minimap.
			* Fixed enabled cave zoom not being used when displaying completely zoomed out enlarged minimap.
			* Fixed incorrect minimap chunk render distance calculation.

			* Changed the version naming convention to something that makes more sense than what I came up with as a kid when I made this mod and kept using to this day for consistency. It's now similar to the world map mod's version naming convention with the difference of the first major version number standing for the year of release.
